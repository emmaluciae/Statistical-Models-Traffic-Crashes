# Statistical Models Traffic Crashes

This project analyzes weekly serious injury and fatal traffic crashes in the City of Chicago.
We use Poisson and Negative Binomial models to test the City’s crash-tracking assumptions and
identify unusually dangerous weeks or patterns.

## Objectives
- Aggregate and model weekly serious injuries and fatalities
- Compare Poisson vs. Negative Binomial fits using MLE and K–S tests
- Visualize outlier weeks and spatial patterns
- Estimate confidence intervals for cellphone-related crashes
- Implement optimization methods (Newton-Raphson, Gradient Descent)
